Hello, this is my first project.

Frankly, I got this idea from the "IOS Academy" page, but:
1) color scale for the background,
2) image counter,
3) I made a few different properties for ImageView myself.

I had a lot of fun doing this project and I will continue to make more beautiful projects :)

see you later...
